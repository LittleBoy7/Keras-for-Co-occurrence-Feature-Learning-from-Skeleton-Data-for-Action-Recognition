# Keras-for-Co-occurrence-Feature-Learning-from-Skeleton-Data-for-Action-Recognition

This is a Keras implemenation for [Co-occurrence Feature Learning from Skeleton Data for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06055).
However, since the author has not released the original code, this implementation could miss some details, so it is just for reference.
